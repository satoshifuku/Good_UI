# About

Good UI is an open-source project inspired by citizen science.
This project purposes to share a good user interface(UI) provided from you and an analysis of why the UI has good.

We would like to create a database of Good UI for a designer in industrial design.
For designers, the database becomes a useful example and the more information is, the more useful for designers.
Thus, this project would like to deal with a lot of information about Good UI.
However, A good UI is hardly aware because it provides us smoothly to understand, easy to use, clear the goal and no-error.
As a result, the information does not efficiently collect by only a few persons. 

We need your cooperation to create the database.
