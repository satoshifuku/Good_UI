## What is Microsoft Surface keyboard

The Microsoft Surface Keyboard is a wireless keyboard for a computer.
Wireless means the keyboard needs supply electricity by a battery.
The keyboard uses two AAA batteries, which are inserted into the back of the keyboard(See the image).

## Signifier

An illustration of the blue AAA batteries drawn on the bottom of the cylinder shows correct orientation on the bottom of the case.
Thanks of the illustration, a user can insert the batteries correctly.

## Mapping

1. The convex in the case(in the front of the image) implies that you connect a minus side of the battery to it. In addition, the concave implies you connect a plus side of the battery on it.

## Affordance

The volume of the case shows the size and number of batteries.
