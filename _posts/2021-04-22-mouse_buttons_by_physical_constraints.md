This introduction is about keyboard. As a characteristic of the
keyboard, the keyboard is an input device used for general computer
operations. There are also membrane keyboards that cover all keys by
using a single board for the entire keyboard, and patograph keyboards
that have a diamond shaped patograph added to the same mechanism as the
membrane type.

One of the affordances for keyboard is “type the key”.

As a keyboard signifier, there are keys on the keyboard.

Also, since these affordances and signifires are considered for the
keyboard as a whole, I think that they will not change even if the
arrangement etc.. is different.
