## What is a Bicycle Locking System

This bicycle locking system allows you to lock your bicycle quickly using a key, thus preventing theft. This system is widely used on city in Japan. The design may vary slightly from one model of bicycle to another, but the mapping and affordance are the same overall.

## Signifiers

The first signifier is the bar that can be seen fully extended when the system is locked. When the system is unlocked, the bar is not visible, and the wheel is not blocked. IIt's a good idea to allow the user to see the movement of the bar. Sometimes, the bar is blocked by the wheel. The user can easily rotate the wheel to a position where the bar is not blocked.

The second signifier is the push button that moves the bar. It's visible and easy to understand that you have to push it to generate an action.

## Constraints

Physical constraint:
The key is unique for each bicycle and can only be inserted in one place on the bicycle. In addition, the key cannot be removed in the unlocked position. You must be in the locked position to remove the key. It is a forcing function that we could call Interlock. Indeed, it enables perfoming actions in the correct order: when you arrive, the bicycle is locked; then you insert the key to unlock it, but you cannot remove the key until you relock the bicycle.

Cultural constraint:
I'm French, and I had never seen this system in France. It can be easily explained. In France, there are many thefts, especially of bicycles. This system is sufficient in Japan because it's not in Japanese culture to steal. In fact, I sometimes forget my keys on the bike all day, and when I come back, they are still there. Japan is a much safer country than France. Indeed, this locking system in France is not sufficient because someone can easily take the bike with their car and then break the system quietly at home. In France, we use chains to secure the bike to an anchored element on the ground. However, that doesn't stop some ill-intentioned individuals from cutting these systems with specialized tools...

## Mapping

The system has a good mapping overall. On one hand, it is discreetly integrated into the bike and placed in the right location. On the other hand, even though this kind of system may vary slightly from one bike to another, the mapping remains consistent, making it very user-friendly due to its standardization.

The push-button also has an excellent mapping as it is directly placed on the object it modifies (the bar). It is easy to push, requiring only one or two fingers.

## Feedbacks

Some feedback mechanisms allow the user to know when the bar is completely locked. Firstly, the user can visually observe the movement of the bar during the locking action. Secondly, there is an audible "click" sound that indicates the bar is locked.

At the same time, the key is positioned to be removed because until then, it was blocked.
