## 100均　両面テープ

It is a double-sided tape with a tape cutter. It has a memory to measure its length before cutting the tape with the cutter.

## Discoverability

The tape is sticky on one side and sealed on the other, so you know which side to put on first. The tape has an adhesive side on one side and a sticker on the other so that you can tell which side is the front and which side to apply first.

## Signifier

There is a gap between the tapes, which makes it easy to pull the tape with the other hand by holding it there.
The scale on the side of the tape makes it easy to adjust the tape to the desired length. It is also a feedback because you can check the length of the tape before cutting it.

## Designed for error

We think that the cutter is located slightly inward, in a place where it might be difficult for people to touch it when they hold this product.

## Conceptual Model

The structure of pulling the tape and cutting it with a cutter uses the conceptual model of cellophane tape.
The gap in the center of the double-sided tape uses the conceptual model of a bag handle.
