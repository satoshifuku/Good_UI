## LCD Writing Tablet

Product from 3COINS. You can write notes on the screen with the pen provided, and then erase the notes by pressing the button with the trash symbol. You can use as many times as you like.

## Signifier

The bin symbol is a signifier that the note is erased. This is similar to the PC bin symbol. The circle around the trash symbol is the signifier that it is a button. So user can try to push.
A depression the same size as the pen is a signifier that a pen can be placed there. And the depression with a narrower tip is a signifier of the direction in which the pen can be inserted.


## Feedback

The click of the button when pressed provides feedback that the button has been pressed. And the screen disappearing provides feedback on the success of the user's operation.
 Feedback is provided by an audible click when the pen is inserted deeply into the pen and it is feedback too that the pen locked in place.
