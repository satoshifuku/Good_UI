## 大和　ＰＵ-２-ＣＢ プッシュワンＭ

There is a silicone button on the top of the soy sauce jug, which is tilted and pressed to release a small amount of soy sauce. Conveyor-belt sushi restaurants use similar soy sauce jugs.

## Discoverability

The transparent container of the soy sauce jug makes it possible to determine what kind of liquid is inside.
It can be seen that what is inside comes out from the protruding place on the left side of the soy sauce jug. I can also determine that it is something that I can pour that liquid on something.

## Signifier

The label reads “ここをプッシュしてください” to indicate the action to the user.
An arrow indicates the location of the white button.


## Affordance

The white button on the top of the soy sauce jug has a projection, affording a person to press that button.

## Physical Constraints

It is designed so that a large amount of soy sauce does not come out at once, preventing the mistake of pouring too much onto food. This is measures to prevent slips in the action base.

If you push it without tilting it, it will not come out. It is designed so that if you just tilt it to the side, only a couple of drops will drip out. This is a little like an interlock.
