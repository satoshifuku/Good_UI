## Umbrella stand

This product is designed to hold umbrellas upright.
They are placed at the entrance of various buildings.
They are especially useful on rainy days when you don't want to carry a wet umbrella indoors.

## Affordance 

The intersecting designs and holes dictate that something is to be stuck and stored.
Each space is individually separated and designed to prevent umbrellas from falling over.
The steel frame-like design also makes it possible to hook something to it.

## Signifier

The design that intersects with the dividers in each space and the fact that the height of the product matches the length of the umbrella indicate that this is a place to store umbrellas standing up.
Thanks to the dividers, it is visually obvious where to put the umbrellas.

## Discoverability

The space for an umbrella is clearly indicated visually thanks to the space, and it is easy to know where to put an umbrella at a glance.

## Physical constraint

Umbrella stand space is limited and can only hold umbrellas of a specific size and shape.
Since only one umbrella can stand in each partition, it is impossible to store many umbrellas at once.
The system also allows users to visually remember roughly where they put up their umbrellas, preventing them from forgetting their own umbrellas.

## Feedback 

The physical stability of the umbrella when it is put up indicates that the umbrella has been stored securely.
The visually available space can be instantly identified, making it easy to find a place to stand the umbrella.
