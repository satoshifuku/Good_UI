## Electric warming air kettle (non-boiling type) WXP-22

This electric kettle dispenses hot water for everyday uses like making tea and coffee.

## Lock Switch

This kettle has a lock switch to prevent unintentional acts like " burning by being poured hot water by mistake." The "push" button in the middle cannot be pushed when the switch is in lock mode. A "lock switch" is provided as a forced selection function to prevent these errors. This act is a physical constraint on the kettle.

## The "push" button

In the middle of the kettle, there is a push button. To dispense the water, the user must input force to bring out the hot water. The extra force needed to dispense the water is to make sure the user does not overflow when getting the water. This also acts as a physical constraint.
