## Dish Counter Water Recovery System

A dish collecting system introduced at sushi chain restaurant Kura Sushi since 1996. Customers can count the number of dishes they have eaten by putting the plate of sushi they have finished eating in the system.

## Affordance

It affords that you can put something in the slot because the depression of the slot is just at hand when you sit down. The depression affords that something can be put in there, and the depression is at hand affords that something can be put in there. The hole at the end of the slope affords that you can slide something in and drop it. In other words, slope affords sliding in that direction, and the hole affords dropping beyond it.

## Signifier

The large arrow next to the words, "Put the finished dish in the slot" signifies that put dish in here. The Hole molded into the shape of a dish in the slot is the signifier to put the dish in the hole.

## Feedback

The dish count on the monitor is increased by one after the dish is put in.  The increase is feedback to user. This will eliminate the user's apprehension.

## Physical constraints

The Hole molded into the shape of a dish cannot be filled with anything other than a dish. This is a lockout to prevent customers from putting in the wrong thing.
