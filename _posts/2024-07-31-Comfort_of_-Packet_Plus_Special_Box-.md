## Yu-packet Plus Special box

At first glance, it appears to be an ordinary cardboard box, but in fact it has excellent UI design. The shape, materials, ease of assembly, and easy-to-understand illustrations are all details that allow users to pack products safely and easily. Effective symbols, fold lines, and size are also symbolic of its excellent UI.

##  affordance

The shape and materials make it intuitive to naturally “assemble” and “insert into the completed box.
In addition, the shape of the tabs and insert parts are designed for ease of assembly, encouraging the natural action of “inserting” the product.

## Signifier

Arrows and illustrations on the surface of the box indicate how to assemble the box in an easy-to-understand manner. The part indicating where to attach the label is also an easy-to-understand signifier that guides the user's action.The shape of the insertion slot is also a signifier that guides the user to the position.

## restriction

In the case of this box, the “restriction” is that the size and shape strictly conform to mailing standards. This prevents users from packing items that are not in compliance, thus preventing delivery problems.

## feedback

Once the packaging is complete, the lid cannot be opened simply by lifting it. At this point, we have visual and tactile confirmation that the box is “securely sealed.
The texture of the sturdy cardboard also provides a tactile indication that the box has been properly assembled and is ready to be shipped.

## conceptual model & interlock

The size and shape of the package strictly conforms to mailing standards, eliminating concerns about deviation from protocol. Delivery completion concerns are also reduced by the fact that the necessary steps to delivery, such as labeling, are indicated.
