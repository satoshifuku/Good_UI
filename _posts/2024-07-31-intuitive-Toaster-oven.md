## Toaster oven

A toaster oven is a household cooking appliance used to quickly bake foods such as bread and pizza. It mainly uses an electric heater to heat the interior to a high temperature. It has a temperature setting dial and timer, allowing for fine-tuning of cooking time and temperature.

## affordance

The toaster oven dial can be rotated to set the time and temperature. This rotating operation is intuitive and easily understood by the user, affording them to make the appropriate settings. This is because it is based on Norman's theory of affordance and is designed so that the user naturally understands how to operate it.

## feedback

When the toaster's timer runs, a tic-tac-toe sound is heard. When the timer reaches zero, a bell rings to inform the user that cooking is complete. This audible feedback enhances user convenience by allowing the user to know the result of an operation without having to visually confirm it. Applying Norman's theory of feedback, it is designed to ensure that the user is aware of the results of the operation.

## signifier

The interior of the toaster is made of glass, allowing you to see the food inside. This visual signifier makes it easy to check the cooking progress. Furthermore, the dials and buttons are designed to be easy to understand for first-time users, with icons and text on the dials and buttons indicating how to operate them. Reflecting the theory behind Norman's Signifier, the controls are designed to allow users to intuitively understand how to operate them.
