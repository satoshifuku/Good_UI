## Escalator

These products are installed in various buildings such as shopping malls.
This product is used to move through different levels.
The moving stair-like steps allow people, shopping carts, etc. to be carried up and down.

## Affordance

The position of the escalator steps and handrails indicate where to stand.

## Signifier

Yellow borders indicate the corners of the steps and visually emphasize where to stand safely.
Signs are posted to indicate how to use the escalator and what precautions to take.
Visual cues of the direction of movement of the handrail and stairs indicate whether the escalator is going up or down.

## Understanding

It is easy to understand whether the escalator is going up or down by the movement of the handrail or stairs.

## Physical constraint

Escalators move only in one direction, so it is impossible to ride in the wrong direction.
Because the size and spacing of the stairs are fixed, there are restrictions on the number of people who can ride the escalator at one time and the size of their belongings.
The raised silver steps at the foot of the stairs and the slanting angle of the steps make it impossible to ride on the silver steps.

## Correspondence

The positions of the steps and handrails correspond to where human hands are placed, so that users naturally know where to stand and place their hands.
